# CDC-United-States-Total-Yearly-Deaths-Visualized

This script uses python and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

You can download the latest "Weekly Deaths by State and Age" csv from the cdc website:
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm

I have provided a example csv from 9/29/2020. The cdc updates this data weekly, so the example is now probably out of date for you.


# Step 1:
Download both the python file and the example csv and place them in the same folder (you can just download the folder i provided).

# Step2:
If you have the correct libraries already installed, run the code in your perfered IDE. 
The example data provided should load because it is relative to the folder i provided. 
(If this doesn't work for you, copy the whole path name ex: C:/Users/Example/Example.csv and paste into the variable "path").

# Step 3:
Get creative. This is just a basic example of how to organize and process a large data set! Explore the csv and the code and see what you come up with!
